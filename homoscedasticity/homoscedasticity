Normal model:
    yhat = b0 + b1 * x1
    as x increases by 1 unit, Y increases by 1 unit

Semi log model:
    yhat = b0 + b1 * (logx1)
    as x increases by 1 percent, Y increases by 1 unit

Semi log model:
    log yhat = b0 + b1 * x1
    as x increases by 1 unit, Y increases b1 percent

    yhat = b0 + b1 * 

Log model (elasticity):
    log yhat = b0 + b1 * (logx1)
    as x increases by 1 percent, Y increases by 1 percent
